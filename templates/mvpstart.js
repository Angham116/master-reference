# MVP start email
To be sent after the first meeting with the client, to confirm the deliverables for the MVP phase of business.
The intention is that after meeting the client to discuss the scope of the MVP and its essential features, you go away and fill in this template.
Once the template has been filled in and sent to the client, they have the opportunity to tweak it and send it back.
After the client has tweaked it and you have reviewed it, send the revised version back to the client as final written confirmation of the deliverables.
At this point, if the client accepts these features, you're good to go.
