These notes are based on a coding club I ran at Morpeth School in 2016. I tried a few different approaches. Here is the one that worked best (edited to remove all my missteps and dead-ends). Stages 1 and 2 were also used for the mini-bootcamp for FACN4 applicants in Nazareth. See https://github.com/foundersandcoders/london-programme/issues/28.

**Stage 1**
1. Sign up for GitHub.
2. Create a mygithubname.github.io repo
3. Add a single index.html with a single line of text and go to the page
4. Add a link to the page on top of the repo, so it can be found again 
5. Go to the settings and go to the automatic page-generator
6. Follow the instructions, create your page
7. Do a bit of a digression on markdown
8. Launch the new page and go and look at it

**Stage 2**
1. Sign up for [c9.io](https://c9.io/)
2. Clone your repo
3. Preview it on c9.io
4. Do some edits
5. See them in preview on c9.io
6. Intro to the command line
7. git status/add/commit/push
8. View your changes on your website on github

**Stage 3**
1. Go and find an interesting javascript game on github, fork it, view it
2. Clone it onto c9 and make some edits to make minor changes
3. View those changes

**Stage 4**
1. Intro to good online learning resources, possibly including [Code.org](https://code.org/), [untrusted](https://alexnisnevich.github.io/untrusted/), [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing) and others.
