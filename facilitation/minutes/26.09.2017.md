### FCI Standup
September 26, 2017

**Present:** Rebecca, Dan, Jen, Matt, MG

**Discussion of user-testing:**
- Mavis: enthusiasm for user-testing, it's possible that we undersold the process, but feels reluctant to force it
- Jen: a case study from a previous FAC illustrating how user-testing can shift a project's trajectory might be useful 
- Jen: in the real world, the product owner conducts the user-testing, not the dev team, and it happens after the sprint, not during the build; dwyl holds the last two days of a two week sprint for bug fixing which gives time for the product owners to user-test
- Jen: is there more we could do to help students learn to manage their time?
- MG: during design sprints, phrasing of questions in English was tough, tomorrow is user-testing, wondering if one day is too much
- Mavis: a shorter period of time might be possible
- Jen: difficult to go off-site in a shorter period of time

**Discussion of case studies:**
- Jen: it would be useful for POs to see examples of what students have built before
- Link to case study process: https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/tree/master/coursebook/weeks-10-12/build-sprint
- https://github.com/foundersandcoders/case-studies
- MG: interested to collaborate on standard formatting/skeletons/frameworks, especially for speakers of English as a second language
- Jen: possibly doing a design sprint case study separately from a build sprint case study
