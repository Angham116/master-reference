# Consensus decision making

## Who are you? 
+ I'm Zooey. Hi.
+ I just graduated Founders and Coders 10.
+ Before this I worked at Lush and taught people to fix their own bikes at London Bike Kitchen
+ I'm now doing an apprenticeship at dwyl.

## What, why how?
+ This will be structured in a what, why, how style, which is the same way our proposals for meeting take!
  
## What?
Consensus decission making is a style of decision making which emphasises consent from **all** individuals in a group. (as founders and coders is a members cooperative, the group in this sense is members of the founders and coders co-operative.)

It is a form of decision making which emphasises communication, coalition and reformulation, as opposed to majority rule.

There are lots of different actualisations of consensus decsision making, and I'll go more into the way FAC does things in the `how` section of this talk. They are, however unified by being a step away from majority rule (by which I mean people vote for/against on proposals and whichever has the majority is what is put through).

Conensus has been used for centuries by lots of groups, including the Quakers and The Haudenosaunee Confederacy (a coalition of Native American groups), it is definitely not a new thing!

## Why?

The why of consensus can be a different in each organisation that does it.
The reason some people in Foudners and Coders have expressed include that it:
+ stops minority voices being crused by the majority, and this is important for an organisation which emphasises community
+ it attempts to stop alienation in **any** members by making sure **everyone** consents to decisions that are made. 
+ It means that everyone who wants to be can be involved in decision making can be
+ a healty community is capable of dealing with disagreements in a healthy way, and producing solutions everyone can consent to.
	+ consensus gives structure to this process
+ It decentralises power, stops any individual or small group of individuals in an organisation being in complete control
	+ As a result of that it spreads accountability throughout the organisation. If things go wrong no one person is left to bear the weight of it, as everyone had the opportunity to collaborate on reformulation, consent to, or completely stop the idea if they so wished.


## how?

One way we probably differ from a lot of other organisations that use consesnus vased decision making is that we use GitHub issues for a lot of it!
Most discussions related directly to activities in london are london-programme, and if you're interested in stuff for the wider F&C organisation, check out international too.
We use it for a number of reasons, one of the big ones being that it means that there is a record of everything!

### I wanna ask a question/have a discussion
+ post an issue in the relevant repo (probably london-programme), and lay out your question, add the `discussion` label! This kind of thing doesn't require any particular style, but things which are mroe specific tend to be more actionable
+ If it's the kind of thing that may warrant it, when community members have contributed and you feel it's ready, raise a proposal issue!

### I want to make a proposal
+ Post your proposal in the Why/What/How format. 
  + Why is this a thing you want to do/want to happen? 
  + What exactly are you proposing? 
  + How will the proposal be actioned?
+ These are all really important! 
+ The context from 'Why?' allows people to see your perspective
+ What is important because have clear explanation of `what` it is you want to do makes it much easier for it to be discussed (non-specific propsals usually get taken back to the drawing board to be made mroe specific)
+ How is important because if it's not clear how a proposal will be actioned then it may as well not happen. It's really hard to decide if you want something to happen if you don't know that it will happen.
+ your proposal will then be discussed by the community! It will be brought to the next business meeting which is at least a week away. (to make sure people have ample time to look at it)
`how to edit propsal will be shown in the demo`

### And now we're in a meeting
At a a meeting there will be a facilitator who will sort of guide how the meeting goes, it's their job to make sure everyone's voice is heard, and to work out when a proposal is ready to be taken to a vote.
The proposal will be discussed and possibly have minor changes made to it, but most of the discussion is supposed to be on the github issue, so that the wider community can be involved, and so we don't get delayed at meetings!
When it's brought to a vote members will be prompted to vote
+ Who are members? Check out the register.md in the london-membership repo. You become eligible for membership once you have attended 2 business meetings, and are added to the register at your 3rd. 
The votes are as follows:
+ Yay
	+ This means you support and agree with this proposal, you want it to go ahead.
+ Abstain
	+ Can mean a few things, can be a lack of nderstanding, feel they have a personal conflict of interest, or that they do not actively agree with the propsal but that they consent to it going ahead
+ Block
	+ If there is even one block the proposal will not go ahead. Blocks cannot be made on a whim and must be based on one of the following things:
	+ The proposal has unresolved issues, and is not ready to be decided upon
	+ The proposal violates the previously agreed upon values of the organisation.
		+ At the moment we have not formulated a set of pre-decided values, we are still in the process, so blocks must be basedo n the first criteria.

If a proposal is passed, then it goes ahead with the how, if it is blocked, the proposal maker(s) are encouraged to talk with the blocker(s) some time after the meeting to create a new proposal that satisfies all of their concerns.

This system can seem a bit weird to people at first! One block can stop a proposal completely?!? what?
We value creating a community where collaboration is prioritised above conflict, and where every member has consented to the actions of the organisation, and we've decided this is the way to go about that.

The next business meeting is 5th of July, you are all encouraged to attend!
