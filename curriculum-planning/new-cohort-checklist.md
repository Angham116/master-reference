# New cohort checklist

The following is a checklist for course coordinators to complete in advance of the start date
of a new curriculum:

- [ ] Create a [gitter](https://gitter.im/) chatroom for FACN-planning under the foundersandcoders organisation.
- [ ] Create a [gitter](https://gitter.im/) chatroom for FACN within the foundersandcoders organisation.
- [ ] Send contact email (via [mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/)) out to F&C alumni to begin arranging external speakers dates for the new curriculum. Update the calendar every time a speaker is arranged.
- [ ] Create a new github organisation for FAC-N with the following structure. [Example](https://github.com/FAC10).
- [ ] Add new cohort to this FAC-N github organisation.
- [ ] Add new cohort to [Founders & Coders](https://github.com/foundersandcoders) organisation.
- [ ] Ensure all curriculum related files are updated: those in the coursebook [general](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/tree/master/coursebook/general) folder & the curriculum ([London](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/london-curriculum), [Nazareth](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/nazareth-curriculum)) repo.
- [ ] Ensure the [coursebook](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/tree/master/coursebook) has been updated by the current mentors before start-date.
- [ ] Invite the new cohort in for an [installation](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/blob/master/coursebook/precourse/installation-list.md) party. Preferably also in advance of the start-date to meet each other and mentors.
- [ ] Arrange dates, and ensure alumni are notified, for a welcoming party in the first week. Add to the calendar.
- [ ] Send email out to alumni and those active in space about start-date of course to increase numbers on the first day.
