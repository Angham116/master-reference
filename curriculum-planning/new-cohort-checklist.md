# New Cohort Checklist

The following is a checklist for both course facilitators and programme director to complete either prior to the beginning of a cohort or served as an on-going reference:

### Prior to the course
Programme director (supported by FCI if necessary):
- [ ] Send acceptance email to successful candidates, including a link to the pre-course material
- [ ] Make sure current CF in all campuses is set as owner of Founders & Coders [organisation](https://github.com/foundersandcoders) (to be removed at the end of their position)

Course Facilitator:
- [ ] Create a new github organisation for FAC-X with the following structure. [Example](https://github.com/FAC10).
- [ ] Add new and previous cohort as owners to this FAC-X Github organisation, then create a students team and a mentors and add everyone accordingly.
- [ ] With a [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/) email template provided by FCI, send out an email with the following:
  - contact alumni about speakers, invite alumni to day one (can be done via Gitter), and invite alumni to a welcome party
- [ ] Create a gitter chatroom for FAC-X within the foundersandcoders organisation, and delete the "incoming"/"lobby" room.
- [ ] Add new cohort to [Founders & Coders](https://github.com/foundersandcoders) organisation, and:
    - [ ] give members "write" access
    - [ ] "no restrictions" on 3rd party application access policy
- [ ] Add new cohort to a FAC-X team within this organisation.
- [ ] Add new cohort to `foundersandcoders` main Gitter room
- [ ] Add new cohort to `city`-specific Gitter room
- [ ] Invite the new cohort in for an [installation](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/blob/master/coursebook/precourse/installation-list.md) party in the last week of FACX-1 to meet each other and mentors.
- [ ] Contacting alumni to create a pastoral care team

Weekly curriculum task group along with current CF / maintainers of the `master-reference`:
- [ ] Ensure all curriculum related files are updated in `master-reference`
- [ ] Ensure the [coursebook](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/tree/master/coursebook) has been updated by the current mentors before start-date.

### On-going

Course Facilitator:
- [ ] Use the Google spreadsheet of past alumni who gave talks / external speakers, stored in school-curriculum, to continue arranging external speaker dates for the new curriculum. Update the list from last curriculum if necessary.
- [ ] Update the calendar every time a speaker is arranged.
