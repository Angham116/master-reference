# New Cohort Checklist

The following is a checklist for both course facilitators and programme director to complete either prior to the beginning of a cohort or served as an on-going reference:

### Prior to the course
Programme director (supported by FCI if necessary):
- [ ] Send acceptance email to successful candidates, including a link to the pre-course material

Course Facilitator:
- [ ] Introduce current mentors to the gitter chatroom for current-mentors under the foundersandcoders organisation.
- [ ] Create a new github organisation for FAC-X with the following structure. Example.
- [ ] Add new and previous cohort as owners to this FAC-X Github organisation, then create a students team and a mentors and add everyone accordingly.
- [ ] With a Mailchimp email template provided by FCI, send out an email with the following:
  - contact alumni about speakers, invite alumni to day one (can be done via Gitter), and invite alumni to a welcome party
- [ ] Create a gitter chatroom for FAC-X within the foundersandcoders organisation, and delete the "incoming"/"lobby" room.
- [ ] Add new cohort to Founders & Coders organisation.
- [ ] Add new cohort to a FAC-X team within this organisation.
- [ ] Add new cohort to `foundersandcoders` main Gitter room
- [ ] Add new cohort to `city`-specific Gitter room
- [ ] Invite the new cohort in for an installation party in the last week of FACX-1 to meet each other and mentors.
- [ ] Contacting alumni to create a pastoral care team

Weekly curriculum task group along with current CF / maintainers of the `master-reference`:
- [ ] Ensure all curriculum related files are updated: those in the coursebook general folder & the curriculum (London, Nazareth) repo.
- [ ] Ensure the coursebook has been updated by the current mentors before start-date.

### On-going

- [ ] Use the Google spreadsheet of past alumni who gave talks / external speakers, stored in school-curriculum, to continue arranging external speaker dates for the new curriculum. Update the list from last curriculum if necessary.
- [ ] Update the calendar every time a speaker is arranged.
