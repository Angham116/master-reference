# Creation of resources

When making a new workshop/morning challenge:
1. Create a new repo within the `foundersandcoders` GitHub organisation.
1. Follow repo naming convention - prepend the name with:
  - `ws-` for workshops
  - `mc-` for morning challenges
1. Make a PR to the `master-reference`, editting the resource index to add a link to your repo
1. Start your repo's `README.md` with a set of learning outcomes
