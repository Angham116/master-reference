# Creation of resources

When making a new workshop/morning challenge:
1. Create a new repo within the `foundersandcoders` GitHub organisation
1. Follow the repo naming convention - prepend the name with:
    - `ws-` for workshops
    - `mc-` for morning challenges
1. Make a PR to the `master-reference`, editing the [resource index](./resource-index.md) to add a link to your repo
1. Start your repo's `README.md` with a set of learning outcomes
1. Ensure your `README.md` contains a link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` in `master-reference`
