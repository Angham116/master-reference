Philippa: Much better than ours (FAC10's). They got it pretty well. All the installation stuff was sorted out.
Alice: 15 mins
Jen: 45 mins


### Steve's talk
+ Alice: same as what we had. Really good intro to the way databases work.
+ Nothing I would change, that I can see of the bat.

### Installation
+ Some misleading things but they're all in issues. Elias might even have sorted them out?
+ Weren't problems, which was pretty amazing.
+ Think he's changing the thing that was supposed to be written as one big script, even though it had comments in

### Morning workshop
+ One of two issues raised. Nothing major

### Afternoon Workshop
+ Problem free. Same as ours

### Code along
Philippa: Code along took quite a lot longer on day 2. Maybe a lot of time needs to be set aside for that, because people have a lot of questions.
Alice: There's a lot of weird stuff in db_connection.js that people.
Philippa: A lot of questions being asked at every single point. This does this thing and connects to that, but the syntax is weird and people would ask why it was written in that way.
Alice: Questions around ES6 syntax.
Philippa: No one really had trouble following along and copying the code.
Philippa: I find it quite hard to be typing something down quite hectically, whilst someone is explaining. Then they can focus on. Not really beneficial to be typing it out at the same time as someone.
Alice: db_connection.js file is just some magic. I don't know what all the lines were doing. I do now, after Elias did the code along.
Philippa: I find the explanation line by line really really good. But I don't know whether they need to be typing it out themselves at the same time.
Alice: Even if
Philippa: With code along you're concentrating on the syntax without really learning it. Half the time the reason you've missed something is because you've missed it on the screen.
Alice: Jen and Alina were away, I was there when they were caught up.


Philippa: Take notes while someone is presenting instead of code along. Your job is
Alice: I would absolutely love it if we had time to take notes.
Philippa: If you had the document in front of you, already written.
Sometimes you don't quite get it because you don't know what's coming up. Like if someone is writing a line where they're initialising a variable and you're going "ok sure...don't know why yet" but you just have to trust that it's necessary.
Feels quite empowering because you've understand pieces of it yourseu lf.
If you were with someone you might say "what they hell is this". Sometimes you have vague understanding from skimming and then there are things that you need to fill in gaps on.
People might have better questions if they've already had a chance to skim it. Going into it blindly, it's just so hectic. So you assume that.

Kind of find code alongs useful, because things get explained to you in more depth than you usually do.
But because everything is new to you, you don't actually understand everything as fully as you think you do.

Seem really good with projects. They're way ahead of anything we did. They're
One of the weeks when we were optimistically.
Just copy all your folders twice.

### Afternoon workshop
+ Issues with solutions. Said it doesn't work.
+ Philippa: No CSS challenge
+ Alice: One girl did it and totally nailed it.
+ 1.5 hours late so they only had half an hour for it. They all did it for another half an hour.
+ Most people got to the post bit.
+ Tacked on at the end.
+ I'd happily go home and do the POST challenge, but I wouldn't bother with the CSS bit. I would if it were during the time allotted for the workshop, but since it wasn't...

### Research
+ All fine apart from testing. Still needs clarification.
+ Some of the groups are alright now. But at the time they seemed a bit flustered.
+ Hard to find examples online with tape. I haven't found a good "test your database with tape" article / resource anywhere.
+ Ideally have some kind of session on testing where we work through it together.
+ Sometimes research afternoons are more beneficial than others. This isn't one of them.

### Morning challenge
+ Good but maybe make no.2 a challenge.
+ Really there's 4 questions. Don't know why 2a and 2b.
+ Question 1 is not the easiest amongst those questions. So maybe just re-order them. At least one of the question 2s is nicer.

### Projects
+ Philippa: questions about testing. Hilariously, because we're such experts. Whether they're supposed to have 2 databases. Whether they have doubled up.
+ Alice: Better introduction to environment variables. It's introduced via a research topic and some people don't seem to totally understand them.
+ Alice: this week was a bit weird. Felt like they didn't really need us.
+ Philippa: Had a few questions during office hours and had people come upstairs once. But very little.
+ Alice: We used ElephantSQL
