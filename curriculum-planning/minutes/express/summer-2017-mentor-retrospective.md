### Express workshop

- Mario - went pretty well , got confused with middleware and no team got past step 7
- Lawson - pretty smooth but need more time
Is the expectation to finish the whole workshop or should they do it on they're own?
- Shireen: They should finish it by themselves, but basics should be done in the classroom

### HandleBars workshop
*We skipped biz-dev, workshop took 4 hours*

- Mario: in London it wasn't a code-along, we decided to do it as a code-along. too much for one workshop.
- Lawson: was pretty good considering it was a code-along but too long and everyone felt like their brains were fired afterwards
it was a good reference for the projects
Express and handlebars were one week but we had 2 weeks.
Should stay in the curriculum but mentors should prepare first
- Mario: It was only me and  Lawson, where Lawson typed and Mario explained it would have been helpful to have an extra mentor for typos and walking around class.
Explain what the mvc model is before jumping into the workshop

### Animator challenge

- Lawson: was good and simple, only one pair finished it but good introduction to animations.
- Lubes: no one used them in the projects.

### Testing Express Routes

- Mavis: raised issues in the repo, we don't have to go through all of them again
- Lubes: would be better if polished for next time, didn't have any testing in the past weeks so would be useful.
Maybe add a test db, not good practice to populate the db each time.

### Research

- Mario: didn't see anyone struggling.
- Mavis: promises should removed or given more guidance.
- Lubes: how about the other topics?

  All agree they weren't bad but forgettable.

### Express HandleBars challenge
- Mario: went pretty smooth, no issues, students got it and did not ask a lot  of questions.
- Lawson: good for boosting their confidence.
the group that researched handlebars finished it.
- Mavis: seems good over all

  Lawson agrees.

### Projects
- Mavis: would you introduce the QA and scrum master roles again?
- Shireen: Would definitely do the scrum mastering again
- Mavis: requires a lot of input from mentors
- Suha: the team she helped needed the guidance
We did not get involved with their ideas, guided them with the planning and opening issues.
- Mario: QAing helped with their work flow and git-flow is a lot better than other weeks.
- Lawson: the team he scrum mastered was fine and did not have any problems
- Lubes: QA part was for emergencies
- Mavis: QA should not happen every time
This week needed this management but don't think it's necessary every week
- Shireen: QAing forced them to look at the code of the other pair and helped them understand the project as a whole.
- Lubes: this happened naturally for facn1 but facn2 didn't do it
if we don't all the time it's nullable.
- Mavis: Should talk to the students about responding to issues in general. mentors should talk to students if they want to get an important point through and not just open an issue about it.
- Lubes: one team didn't need the QAing, why not tell them what to do?
- Mavis: identify the problem, talk to them about git-flow and how to work on their own.
- Suha: explanations were done but the students didn't follow any of the advice.
