## Nazareth - Summer Cohort Curriculum Planning

+ installation party 2-3 days before the course starts
+ more time for workshops

Research:
  + Students usually copy paste and dont really understand the topic.
  + Students dont have time to go through what others researched.
  + Students presentations are not clear.
  + It could work if there are more directed questions.
  + Give list of rec resources
  + Mentor introduction to the topics
  + HOW and WHAT to present ?
  + Readmes are not the best way to present
  + Building small project with the topic in the center makes more sense
  + Was not clear how to conduct the research
  + Every research should have an example

week 1
  + Git workshop should code along
  + Git workshop should have been done on students project
  + Glossary of terms and commands for git
  + Replace ACC WS with CSS WSS(FB, MQ)
  + Combine ACC WS with MC

Esraa note: I dont think TDD is that simple as introduced in the second week.
Lubs: Easy to understand the concept, hard to implement it
week 2
  + It will be helpful to introduce TDD with real project(Code along)
  + introduction to better layout practices/structure/design pattern(Elias workshop from week3 can be helpful here, Naz cohort didnt do it fully)
  + was not easy to understand the skeleton code

week 3
  + Parallel functions MC was good
  + Elias WS should  be in week 2**

week 4
  + Node Girls workshop was really good(if you finish it...give more time)
  + Tape-testing workshop isnot helpful because its copy-paste
  + Make sure everyone understand what is NPM
  + Make sure everyone understand node core packages exist
  + Modularise a Node.js server MC +1

week 5
  + Shot and Tape workshop can be in week 4
  + Error handling workshop required alot direction from mentors

  + The project was smiliar to previous weeks

weeks 5 & 4 GN

  + more HBS
