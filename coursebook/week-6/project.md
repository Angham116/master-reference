## Project

This week's project will involve making a node.js backend that connects to a database (either hosted on elephantsql.com or locally) and provides this information to the client-side. Some suggested ideas are below. Feel free to modify according to your interest, provided your idea has similar functionality:

* F&C book sharing system (I can add a book, view all books, reserve a book and unreserve a book)

* Food / coffee recommendations around F&C (I can add a coffee shop, rate it, search existing suggestions)

* F&C events calendar (I can add an event like a meetup to a calendar, view existing events, and sign up to attend i.e. add my name as there is no auth)

As we have not yet covered templating you will need to make the requests and update the DOM in response using client-side JavaScript. As well as serving static HTML and JS files, your server will also need to provide endpoints that return DB query results as JSON. You can query these using XHRs.
