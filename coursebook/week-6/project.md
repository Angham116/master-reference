## Project

This week's project will involve making a node.js backend that connects to a database (either hosted on elephantsql.com or locally) and provides this information to the client-side. Some suggested ideas are below. Feel free to modify according to your interest, provided your idea has similar functionality:

### F&C book sharing system

* I can see a list of all books that are available

* I can add a new book to the list

* I can reserve an available book, taking it out of the available list

* I can unreserve a book, making it available again

### Food / coffee recommendations around F&C

* I can see a list of recommended places

* I can add a new place

* I can add a rating/review of existing places

### F&C events calendar

* I can see a list of upcoming events

* I can add a new event

* I can register my attendance at an event

You will need to make the requests and update the DOM in response using client-side JavaScript. As well as serving static HTML and JS files, your server will also need to provide endpoints that return DB query results as JSON. You can query these using XHRs.
