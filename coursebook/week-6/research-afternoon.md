## Research afternoon

### Types of DBs
  - SQL vs ORM (NoSQL)
  - When to chose SQL over ORM and vice versa

### Schemas and relationships
  - What is a schema and why/when would you need one?
  - What are primary keys and why do we need them?

### Database setup and maintenance
  - What is a build script and why do you need one? (think ahead to how this might come in useful when working on a project this week)
  - Create a build script for a simple database (one or two tables only), which you can run locally. Check that it works for you and everyone on your team

### Script injections / safety issues
  - What is a script injection and how do these happen?
  - How would you prevent script injections?
  - Prepare a short demonstration of good (and bad?) practices, including some sample code
