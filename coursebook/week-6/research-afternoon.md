## Research afternoon

### Schemas and relationships
  - What is a schema and why/when would you need one?
  - What are primary keys and why do we need them?
  - Find some examples of visual representations of schemas
  - Create your own mock schema (you can use a tool like myBalsamiq to sketch it) for a database about Founders & Coders (it's up to you what kind of data this would include)
  - Try and incorporate as many different kinds of relationship into your schema as you can and be prepared to explain the logic behind it!

### Database setup and maintenance
  - What is a build script and why do you need one? (think ahead to how this might come in useful when working on a project this week)
  - Create a build script for a simple database (one or two tables only), which you can run locally; check that it works for you and everyone on your team

### Testing
  - What JavaScript / Node.js tools are available for testing a database?
  - Why would you mock a database and how does this help with testing?
  - Research the Sinon mock library and prepare a demo on how to use it.

### Script injections / safety issues
  - What is a script injection and how do these happen?
  - How would you prevent script injections?
  - Prepare a short demonstration of good (and bad?) practices, including some sample code
