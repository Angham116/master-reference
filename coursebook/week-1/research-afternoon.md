# Research Afternoon

## Command Line
1. Research how to:
  + customise your command line
  + install a program from source
2. Create a "workshop" to walk someone through the steps (this doesn't need to be long - just one markdown file)

## Git
1. Research:
  + "best practices" for committing and making pull requests
  + using labels & milestones (you might want to look at DWYL's preferred workflow, as this is what you will be using later in the course)
2. Create a CONTRIBUTING.md for your own website to reflect what you've learned

## Accessibility
1. Research how to:
  + write an accessible navbar
  + write an accessible modal  
  (Hint, think about: semantic HTML, managing focus, adding key handlers, adding aria attributes)
2. Refactor one of your team's websites (or one from the rest of your cohort if necessary) to reflect what you've learned

## CSS
1. Research:
  + responsive vs mobile-first design
  + how to write CSS with BEM
2. Refactor one of your team's websites to reflect what you've learned
