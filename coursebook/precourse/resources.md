# Resources

Congratulations to all of you on being part of the next F&C cohort!

F&C is an intense course, and you should make sure you're well-rested and ready to work when you get here. Below is a list of material that will help you to be prepared for the start of the course. The list might look a bit long, but each resource itself is quite short. Doing bitesized chunks little and often should make this manageable before the course begins. Your curriculum is designed with the assumption that you'll be familiar with the high priority resources by week one.

Please do not forget that **we don't use frameworks at FAC** – ignore Bootstrap and JQuery, and make sure you work in vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Head over to our [house rules](../general/house-rules.md) to find out why.

You should also refrain from using ES6 syntax for now, as it is not yet supported across all browsers. (More on ES6 to come later on in the course.)

If you have any problems with the following material, feel free to reach out to us through your cohort's gitter channel!

## High priority

### Command Line

Learn Python The Hard Way has a great [Command Line Interface Crash Course](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendixa.html). Use this to become familiar with navigating around your computer without using a GUI.

### Git & Github

[Udacity's git & github course](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775) is a brilliant set of videos. The course is quite long, so don't worry about completing the whole thing. We will go into more depth in week 1. For now, _just complete lesson 1_.

### Markdown

No github repo is complete without proper documentation. Follow this [markdown tutorial](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/lesson/1/) to learn the syntax that you need to write a banging Readme!

### Semantic HMTL

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=GB&hl=en-GB&v=OGg8A2zfWKg) is a 6 minute youtube video to introduce you to the concept of the semantic web. You will be expected to write semantically during week 1, so brush up with the following:

Read [this article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/01/the-importance-of-sections/#the-problem-with-div) to stop using too many divs (divitis). Don't be fooled by the scroll bar - the article isn't particularly long, but there are many comments below.

Head to [this article](https://codepen.io/mi-lee/post/an-overview-of-html5-semantics) for more specific examples of useful semantic tags.


### CSS

This section includes condensed articles/videos that will be beneficial when tackling CSS throughout the course;

1. [**Learn Layout**](http://learnlayout.com) is a helpful, lightweight, well-ordered guide that covers a lot of concepts in CSS to help you understand how to create a super basic layout. Additional links are provided in each section for more detailed explanations of concepts.
2. [**Relative & Absolute Positioning**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFtByxWjfLY) this great 7 minute video will cover the position property, after watching you’ll be able to apply positioning techniques with layout techniques from the [Learn Layout](http://learnlayout.com) video to accomplish many important tasks like [centering](https://css-tricks.com/centering-css-complete-guide/).
3. [**CSS Specificity**](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/07/css-specificity-things-you-should-know/) is an essential guide to understanding how CSS rules are applied and how CSS works in general.
4. [**Rem/Em Units**](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/comprehensive-guide-when-to-use-em-vs-rem--cms-23984) this is another essential guide to help you understand the differences between em and rem units and how to combine them effectively.

### JavaScript

1. [Understanding The Weird Parts: First 3.5 hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv_5Zv5c-Ts) will help build a deeper understanding of many of JavaScripts core concepts. Followed by...
2. [What the heck is the event loop anyway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ) is a half-hour video that you may want to come back to repeatedly throughout the course. It gives a bit of an understanding about how everything fits together and a nice introduction to the concept of callbacks.

## Recommended

### DOM Manipulation

1. [Call Me Nick - DOM Manipulation Basics](http://callmenick.com/post/basics-javascript-dom-manipulation) will cover a lot of the basics.
2. [Appspot's DOM Tutorials: Exercises 1,2 & 3 only](https://dom-tutorials.appspot.com/static/index.html) will help put that into practice.

### APIs

[Learn APIS: First 4 chapters](https://zapier.com/learn/apis/) introduces basics of APIS, HTTP, and API keys

### Chrome Dev Tools

[Free Code Camp: Chrome Developer Tools](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map) has about 30 minutes worth of video content with quizzes after each video.

### Practical Project

The main [objective](learning-objectives.md) of your precourse material is to become comfortable with the topics in the material above. However, from our experience, you'll find working on a personal project _very_ useful to cement this knowledge. We recommend that you try putting this all into practice by building a calculator, as suggested in the [FCC Advanced Front End Development Projects](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-javascript-calculator). Make sure to host your project on github pages.

Rather than using Codepen or JS Fiddle, you should do this directly with your text editor, terminal and browser. Start by creating your repo on Github and try to stick to the command line for adding, commiting and pushing your changes as you go. Don't forget to add some documentation ;)

Have fun, and don't hesitate to use your gitter channel! If anyone has already made a calculator and feels that they need a different challenge, please message one of us on there.
