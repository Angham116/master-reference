## Learning outcomes

+ ***Why*** write Elm instead of "JavaScrip" web applications?
+ Learn the language syntax: http://elm-lang.org/docs/syntax
+ Learn Elm Architecture: https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/
and how knowing Redux (_from last week_) is _useful_ now.
+ Follow the guide and do all the examples _together_:
https://github.com/evancz/guide.elm-lang.org
+ Follow the "Frontend Masters" Elm Tutorials
because they are _hands-down_ the "_best_" fastest way to learn Elm.
+ ***Give back*** to Open Source Community by contributing
to @rtfeldman's Elm Workshop.
The _best_ way we know to help future members of our Community
(_F&C, Elm and the wider Web/Native App Development communities
  who all benefit from Elm's addoption!_) is to _enhance_
  the existing Elm Workshop by helping to _transcribe_ the videos:
https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-workshop/issues/8 _Why_?
  + What's in it for me...? (_good question_!) _participation_ in the _wider_
  [FLOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)
  community which expands your own knowledge & understanding,
  your _technical_ "_social network_" and horizons in general!
  (_ask [Rafe](https://github.com/rjmk) how he "got good" at coding!!_)
  + help future learners get to grips with what they need to know
  so _they_ can _contribute_ to the projects you are about to start building!!

+ ***`after`*** you have given back
by helping to _transcribe_ the Elm-workshop videos,
it's time to _focus_ on the F&C Organization/Community
and _use_ your knowledge of Elm to make something _useful_ for F&C!
