# Final Project / _Hackathon_ `->` Hard Deadline: Friday 16:00

Once you are _reasonably_ confident in your Elm skills,
it's time to _use_ those super-powers for _good_.

> great responsibility

## Why?

### Founders & Coders and all future technology learners need(s) _your_ help!

`while` _we_ have come a _long_ way in the past few years,
there are still _many_ areas of F&C that _can_ be ***improved***.

At this point in the "_course_" you will all have enough insight into what
_can_ be _improved_ about F&C to write down the most pressing issues
because you will have **_felt_ the _pain_** and had _time_ to think about it!

> feel the pain

The group/team projects you have worked on until this point in the "_course_"
have been _demanding_, because you had to acquire _new_ skills `while` you
were building the "thing". This challenge is no _less_ demanding in that it
will require you to ***think creatively*** and produce something _useable_
and _useful_ by the end of the week!

_Please_ follow these **steps** they are _all_ important. <br />
(_note: the steps are fairly obvious and can be reviewed/revised in
  SGC at the end of the week_)

## What?

Founders & Coders is a (_reasonably_) well-defined setup.

> what is F&C videos

And (_to an extent_) we have a good vision for the future (_help still needed/wanted!_)

> vision for the future

What we _need_ is to **_leverage_ technology**
and the collective **creativity**, **skills** and **efforts**
of our members to _make_ useful things we which help
us make the Organization _sustainable_.

_Many_ ideas have been discussed in the past and some were _really_ good<sup>1</sup>!

> **Note**: Rather than _telling_ people ***what*** to build we _prefer_ to
point you in the _direction_ of what you _can_ do ...
(_if people **prefer precise requirements/instructions** we can **easily** write those out e.g: https://github.com/dwyl/terminate/issues/29 ... we just think this gives you more of a chance to think and be creative..._)

## _Who_?

+ _Everyone_ in the cohort.
(_this is your last day together as a Cohort, make the most of and enjoy it!_)
+ _Anyone_ `else` in the F&C Community (_both alumni, directors and mentors_!)
that you feel can contribute to _understanding_
the challenge/problem!
Mention people in the issue(s) you create
so there is a "_paper trail_" of who has been "_consulted_",
and ensures as many voices/ideas/insights are represented/captured;
there's a _high_ chance that someone else will have insight
into the challenge/problem you are attempting to solve, _ask_ them!!


## How?

Each Step in this process needs to be time-boxed
to avoid running _out_ of time!
A "Hackathon" is about _high-intensity_ and _focus_
not chit-chat and distractions.
Today you will be `done` by ***16:00***.
You will manage your own time but stay focussed on the end-of-day goal.
This is a test of your **teamwork** skills
as much as your technical/development skills,
so if someone is "_stuck_" help them get _un stuck_.
Cross the "_finish line_" together.
Remember that you don't _need_ a fully-functioning app by the end of the day,
but you do need to _deliver_ something that shows _how_ you _intend_ to
solve the challenge and document _comprehensively_

### Step 1: _Discover_ the _Highest Value_ Challenge (25mins)

Thankfully, many of you _already_ know what the *highest value*
"***things we need to fix***" in F&C are ...
so this exercise does not _need_ to take very long.

+ Get **Post-its & Sharpies** (_we should have enough in F&C/DWYL if you can't find enough, ask!_)
+ Individually or in _Pairs_ spend **5 minutes** "_brain storming_" the
***highest value/impact/pain challenges/problems that F&C has/faces***.
Write **one** "issue" per **post-it**. (_don't "worry" about "wasting" Post-its! they are cheap compared to how much time/money we are burning by not fixing F&C's most fundamental problems..._!)
... in 5 minutes so don't go over this time and don't get distracted "_chatting_" about the potential solutions either; just define the issue in as few words as possible.
+ **Group** the Post-its on the wall and see what emerges. this should take no longer than **5 mins**.


### Step 2: _Select_ the Challenge (25 mins)

+ As a _cohort_ select the **_highest value_ challenge(s)** from the list
you have collated from your Post-its.

### Step 3: _Describe_ the Challenge in a `new` Issue

+ ***Search*** through https://github.com/foundersandcoders
using the GitHub Full-text-search.
+ Paste links any _existing_ issues stating the problem/challenge
in the `description` of the `new` issue.

> This issue will be our `Epic` with the _broad_/_high-level_ description
of the Challenge/Problem we need to solve.
It will have a checklist that will link to _smaller_ issues.

### Step 4: _Research Existing_ Projects Matching the Challenge (50 mins)

+ Research the _Existing_ Projects Attempting to Address the Challenge)
+ Add links to any _Existing_ Projects in the `new` issue description
(_you created in step 3_)

### Step 5: Use Your Skills (TBD hours/mins)

+ Use _any_/_all_ skills you have accumulated in the past 11.5 weeks
to _make_ something useful.

### Step 6: Wrap Up at 15:30 (25 mins)

### Step 7: Present to the Group at 16:00 (50 mins)


> Note: We will have Stop-Go-Continue as usual for the whole week at 17:00.

# tl;dr <small>(_notes on existing internal projects_)</small>

<sup>1</sup> A few _promising_ internal projects which could use some
[***help***](https://youtu.be/1PWk3i9WT-8)
to be further developed
to make the F&C _organization_ ***much bettererer***! <br />
projects listed `ORDER BY VALUE_TO_ORG DESC;`


+ ***Cashflow*** https://github.com/foundersandcoders/london-money
 ***cash*** is the **lifeblood** of the organization, even if we think
  _being "**poor** is a **good thing**"_ ... knowing **exactly** how much
  money we have in the bank (and in receivables) is **essential**
  for ensuring that everyone knows **precisely** how much we need
  to "keep the lights on".
  + **TODO**: Build a ***live dashboard*** of our _current_ cashflow position,
  clearly display how much cash we have
  vs. how much we (still) need for `this` month
  or any of our other
  [_amazing projects_](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/nazareth-programme)
  (current or future)
  so that **everyone** in the org/community
  **knows** where we are with our finances at **all times**!_)


+ ***Jobs***: https://github.com/foundersandcoders/fac-jobs-board
Tracking the **Jobs** available to **F&C Graduates** in a systematic way
(_not gitter!_)
is of _high_ value to _both_ this could _restricted_ to members of the F&C community using [GitHub Auth](https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-github) and could store a person's profile and let people list the types of employers they are looking for.
Yes, it's similar to `{Insert Name of Recruitment Startup Here}`
but the _crucial_ difference is that if we have a _good_ Jobs board which is actively maintained, the revenue from "_placing_" people in jobs goes
to making F&C _sustainable_ not into the BMW Payments for a "Tech Recruiter"... :heart:
> tech recruiters ... how/why is this still a thing?!
https://www.linkedin.com/vsearch/f?type=all&keywords=technology+recruiter

+ ***News Letter*** (_mass communication_):
https://github.com/foundersandcoders/old-newsletter
email newsletters are the ***single most effective*** way of communicating
with existing people in a time-shifted
(_because you don't have to be constantly watching the "chat" channel_)
and succinct/focussed way!
This repo appears to be "old" but  
[_does **not contain** an explanation as to WHY
or a
link_](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/old-newsletter/tree/baa7dd3778e071c6f31703f658df204475e30a50)
to where the `new` project that solves the "_mass communication_" problem is...

+ ***Knowledge Sharing***: https://github.com/foundersandcoders/resource-sharing
this is the _single_ best way we can help
**future learners _and existing_ members** stay up-to-date with their knowledge,
skills and tools. It's not high "_monetary_" value to F&C in the "_short term_"
but it's of _exceptionally_ high value to the members in both short & long term!
The more people _know_, the more they can achieve, the better it reflects on
all of us! Sharing links to "_thins-of-interest_" in Gitter
is a great way to _lose_ that information.
(_because it only gets seen by a handful of people and then dissapears!_)
It's fine for meetups that are happening on _that_ day,
but myopic for virtually _everything_ `else`.
Let's fix it by making a tool that is "_as easy to use as chat_"
and offers substantially more value to all users!

+ https://github.com/foundersandcoders/chandelier

+ **Alumni Network(ing) Dinners**: https://github.com/foundersandcoders/monthly
(_regular dinners for Alumni organized by
  [@RonanYeah!](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/monthly/commits/master
  'lead by example by always committing directly to master')
this could be made into a collaborative thing
rather than relying on one time-scarce Software Engineer...
**Tip**: send out a **calendar invite** with the monthly newsletter
so people know when/where the next one is, and they can **automatically
add** it to their calendar along with the latest F&C news so they
know what's going on and are "all caught up" before they arrive!
see: [The Todo List](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/monthly/blob/master/INFO.md#to-do)
... not to be **confused** with the [**DWYL lunch/dinners**
which are **Always Vegan & Free**](https://github.com/dwyl/hq/issues/121)_)

As you can _see_ some people _have tried_ to solve _some_ of the
_important_ organizational challenges before ...
with varying degrees of enthusiasm/momentum/success...

## Process _Matters_

***Only*** by _diligently_ following the [_contributing instructions/process_](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) will _any_ meaningful progress be towards making F&C sustainable. ***Specifically***:
+ ***Discuss*** the challenge/idea/suggestion in an `issue` `before` diving into fixing/implementing it!
+ ***Never*** `commit` your changes (_directly_) to `master`
_especially_ without referencing an issue/dicsussion!
It's an _exceptionally_
[***bad habit***](https://youtu.be/zGbOF4UPpfs?t=2m37s)
which just shows
_complete disregard_ for ***clearly communicating*** with your _colleagues_
and _screams_:
"_my contributions don't need to be peer-reviewed because they are always perfect!_"
+ ***Test*** your work/code!! It's _easy_ to take for _granted_ that
what we aremaking "just works", but
without tests ***reliability*** is ***impossible***!
+ ***Document/Comment*** your work/code!
"_What gets measured get's `done`_"
