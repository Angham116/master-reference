## Final Project / Hackathon - Deadline: Friday 16:00

Once you are _reasonably_ confident in your Elm skills,
it's time to _use_ those super-powers for _good_.

> great responsibility

## Why?

### Founders & Coders and all future technology learners need(s) _your_ help!

`while` _we_ have come a _long_ way in the past few years,
there are still _many_ areas of F&C that _can_ be ***improved***.

At this point in the "_course_" you will all have enough insight into what
_can_ be _improved_ about F&C to write down the most pressing issues
because you will have **_felt_ the _pain_** and had _time_ to think about it!

> feel the pain

The group/team projects you have worked on until this point in the "_course_"
have been _demanding_, because you had to acquire _new_ skills `while` you
were building the "thing". This challenge is no _less_ demanding in that it
will require you to ***think creatively*** and produce something _useable_
and _useful_ by the end of the week!

_Please_ follow these **steps** they are _all_ important. <br />
(_note: the steps are fairly obvious and can be reviewed/revised in
  SGC at the end of the week_)

## What?

Founders & Coders is a (_reasonably_) well-defined setup.

> what is F&C videos

And (_to an extent_) we have a good vision for the future (_help still needed/wanted!_)

> vision for the future

What we _need_ is to **_leverage_ technology**
and the collective **creativity**, **skills** and **efforts**
of our members to _make_ useful things we which help
us make the Organization _sustainable_.

_Many_ ideas have been discussed in the past and some were _really_ good<sup>1</sup>!

Rather than _telling_ people ***what*** to build (_which we **can** do if people prefer precise requirements/instructions ..._) we _prefer_ to
