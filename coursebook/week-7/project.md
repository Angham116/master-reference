## Project

Blog with CMS (content management system)

### Task
- This week you'll build a blog with a CMS (content management system) using the Hapi.js framework!
- You'll use a postgreSQL database to store and retrieve your data.
- You'll use the retrieved data to populate a handlebars template for _server-side_ rendering to be displayed on the front-end.


### Goals

The primary aim of this project is to get comfortable with setting up a hapi server and to discover the awesomeness of handlebars.js! Spend time considering how to format your; helper functions, layouts, partials and views.


Whats also important is:

- Use the hapi-auth-cookie module for session management with cookies
- Use the server.inject method to test your server
- Aim for as high test-coverage as possible, on front-end and back-end
- Try to use basic ES6 syntax in this project

Stretch Goals:
- Host your website on Heroku - you might find [Elephant Sql](https://www.elephantsql.com/) useful for hosting your database!)
