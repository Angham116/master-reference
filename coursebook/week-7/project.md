## Project
### Task

<p style="text-align: center;">You are free to create any kind of site that you like, so get creative!</p>

Make sure you're creating your site from a user-centred design perspective, by starting your planning phase with user stories. You always want to be building the most important features first.

The only limits are that your project must fulfill the requirements below.

### Requirements
+ [ ] Login form with 2 fields - username and password
+ [ ] Client-side _and_ server-side validation on login form, including error handling that provides feedback to users
+ [ ] Users only have to log in once (i.e. implement a cookie-based session on login)
+ [ ] Username is visible on each page of the site after logging in
+ [ ] Authenticated users should be able to add new content (CREATE) & edit the content that they have submitted (UPDATE).
+ [ ] An unauthenticated user should be able to view the content (i.e. READ)
+ [ ] Name of the author should be visible against each post
+ [ ] Website content should be stored in a database

Note:
+ Client-side and server-side validation on content posting is optional
+ Whether you also allow users to delete the content that they have posted will depend on the project you decide to create.

#### Possible stretch goals
Roles and permissions:
+ [ ] Have an "admin" level user (role) who can edit and delete all posts :scream: (permissions)

More features:
+ [ ] Add comment functionality to posts
+ [ ] Add like functionality to posts

#### Examples
You could use auth to make a game, a todo app, a [twitter clone](http://canaryapp.herokuapp.com/) :heart: or whatever.
