# Research afternoon

## Validation

1. Research what data validation is, and how it can be implemented it in Hapi.
2. Create a basic Hapi project, in which you use Joi to validate that the user-provided e-mail and password are of the correct format.

## Authentication

1. Research what authentication and password encryption are, and how they can be implemented in Hapi.
2. Create a basic Hapi project, in which you use Bcrypt to hash stored passwords, and use hapi-auth-basic to authenticate a user based on the provided password.

## Cookies and caching

1. Research what cookies are, and why they can be useful to remember stateful information.
2. Research what caching is, and why is it important for your application's performance.

_Note: we will have a walk-through on how to implement cookies in Hapi tomorrow morning._

## Templating with helper functions
