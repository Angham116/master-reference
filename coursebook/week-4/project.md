## Project

### Autocomplete website/widget

Description: Autocomplete enables users to quickly find and select from a pre-populated list of values as they type, leveraging searching and filtering.
> Consider how this adds to the UX!

### Task

Your task is to build a site which will update as you type (an autocompleter).


1) We expect __Tape testing__, test as many components as you can.

2) Try to host your project on __heroku__, [see resource](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#introduction).

3) Implement __module.exports__ and __require__ (and hence great server file structure).

4) You'll need a large data file, consider the best data structure for this... you can find many online.
