## Project

Build a server-rendered full-stack app

### Task
- Build an app using the Express framework.
- Use a PostgreSQL database to store and retrieve your data.
- Use the retrieved data to populate a Handlebars template for _server-side_ rendering to be displayed on the front-end.

### Goals

The primary aim of this project is to get comfortable with setting up an Express server and to discover the awesomeness of Handlebars! Spend time considering how to format your helper functions, layouts, partials and views.

### What's also important:

- Include tests and set up code coverage.
- Use Heroku or a similar service to host the app and the database.
- Try to include ES6 syntax on the server.
