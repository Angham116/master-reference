#House Rules (Work in Progress)

+ **Whilst you're a student, arrive on time & let people know in advance if you're going to be away**. Lots of people are giving freely of their time and knowledge to make FAC possible and giving up other commitments to be here.

+  **Tidy up after yourself** (at least!). With so many of us in the space, it's easy for the kitchen area to get dirty really quickly - wash up your crockery rather than forgetting about it in the sink and wipe down the counter area you've been using it and we'll all be a lot happier :blush:

+ **Clean desk policy**. We have a clean-desk policy. Please leave your desk clear before you leave each day.

+ **Hot desking**. Please sit anywhere downstairs when you arrive each morning.

+ **20-minute rule**. Struggle is good, but not too much of it. As a general rule, if you cannot solve a problem within 20 minutes, then stop and talk to somebody about it (there should be a timer on your desk)

+ **No frameworks**. For the first 10 weeks of the course, stick to vanilla JavaScript. That means no frontend frameworks (i.e. no Bootstrap/jQuery etc...). We want you to build your skills without being reliant on these.
  + If you fully appreciate what problems each framework is solving, you are then able to make more effective judgements on which technologies to use in future.
  + It arms students with the flexibility to switch between technologies, as the popularity of each one can shift.
  + F&C values are heavily aligned with open source software. You should be better able to contribute to and improve upon existing technologies if you have a deeper understanding of what is going on.
