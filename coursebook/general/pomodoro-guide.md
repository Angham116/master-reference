## Time Management Tools

##### We would like to introduce pomodoro clock and other time management tools to the students as a strategy to use when working on projects.
##### The mentors will explain the benefits of using time management tools and will demo several example.   


### Time management tools can help the students:
* Avoid struggling too much to solve a problem, which can be very frustrating.
* Remember to take frequent breaks.
* Allow the team to manage their project time in an organized way.

### Examples of tools:
