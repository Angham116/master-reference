# Project

Each week, you will be split into teams of 4 by your mentors. These teams will be changed twice during the first half course, to give you a chance to work with as many other members of your cohort as possible.

The teams stay together for the following weeks:
+ First team = weeks 1-3
+ Second team = weeks 4-6
+ Third team = weeks 7-8

Your mentors will let you know which teams you will be in at the beginning of weeks: 1, 4 & 7. Have a chat with your team when it first forms, and come up with a team name.

## Creating repositories for each project
Inside your GitHub organisation - [London](https://github.com/FAC10), [Nazareth](https://github.com/FACN1) - you will see three repositories that have been created for you:
+ `prerequisites-gh-pages`
+ `research`
+ `morning-challenge-solutions`

When you create repositories for your weekly projects, please follow this naming convention:
`week1-<name of team1>`
`week1-<name of team2>`
`week1-<name of team3>`
`week1-<name of team4>`

`week2-<name of team1>`
`week1-<name of team2>`
`week1-<name of team3>`
`week1-<name of team4>`

etc.

This will make it much easier to find your projects in future.

Aside from these repositories, the organisation is yours and you are free to add whatever you would like inside.
