## History of "business development" at Founders & Coders

- A few London cohorts back, @sofer introduced a time slot for _business development_ into the FAC curriculum in order to engage current students in the running and development of the programme. In the beginning, students in London worked directly with @sofer and other alumni on tasks ranging from setting up schools workshops and inviting alumni in for talks. 
- When preparations began for the Nazareth programme, @sofer became less available in London. He suggested that _business development_ focus on tasks that could be accomplished without his hands-on support. Together @sofer and @rebeccaradding brainstormed what those tasks might be and how to provide students with enough direction to use their time productively.
- After experiencing business development firsthand, @jsms90 suggested that this time could be spent more productively if groups had more clearly defined remits, and someone in the organisation to whom they could turn for guidance. FAC11 and FACN2 experimented with this relatively more structured format, with mixed results.
- Given that Gaza Sky Geeks has programme staff capable of running and developing the programme, FACG2 has not yet allocated time in the schedule for _business development_.
- In both London and Nazareth, running business development time in this way required quite a bit of planning (to think through the assignments in advance) and hands-on support during the time block (from the course facilitator and/or mentors and "point people"). It has been suggested that further clarity around assignments and alumni support would improve the time slot, but this is not a certainty.
