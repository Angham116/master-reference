# Product Build

## Outline

Students will complete a two / three week project after the taught course. In teams of two or four each project will allow students to further one or more of the following aims: build a product that they care about / learn entrepreneurial skills / learn new technologies that will directly impact their employability.

## Objectives (think: user stories)

  1. Allow students to learn technologies they feel will help them in the hiring process Some students have been frustrated in the past, as they have wanted to learn technologies they felt would help them get a job. This proposal gives students the chance to choose what they want to learn.
  2. Enable students to contribute to the community's learning resources, by creating readmes for other developers Each team which uses a technology that is not part of the curriculum is expected to document their learning. In this way, those that come after them can learn the same material in a shorter time-span. This can be done by contributing to an existing DWYL / FAC readme, or by starting a new one. Given that students will have 2 / 3 weeks learning this new technology, this will give them time to get the proper understanding required to write something useful for other developers. Previously there was no part of the course which has been effective in getting students to create readmes.

      *Perhaps #2 should not be a stand-alone "objective" of these weeks? We should probably be baking the concept of 'documenting your learning' (and therefore contributing to our resources) into every bit of the course?*

      *em: I disagree, in the past there has been an expectation for students to contribute to readmes, it has not worked! I do not feel the new curriculum addresses this. I not think it is possible to make a meaningful contribution to a readme in the tight timescales of a week. In the case where students are struggling to find the time to learn / understand a new technology, there is not time to also create a readme. I think it is clear that readme day does not work. Unless we are setting aside considerably more time for students to be documenting their learning, this will not happen on this course.*

      *The idea was to make sure that the learning outcomes were directly in line with what students themselves want to achieve at this stage. But perhaps we were getting slightly off-base here, turning the learning outcomes of the week into user stories?*

      *You're right that this is a valuable teaching point, especially if we don't feel like we are integrating spikes/documentation adequately in weeks 1-8 (but that's a serious problem in itself). Are students going to achieve this learning outcome if they choose not to learn a completely new technology? Do they have a choice?*

      *If yes, should it be a sub-aim of #1?
      If no, then I think they need serious guidance on how to fit this in during a sprint. Especially since our attempts at helping students to grasp new concepts during readme days have been proven to be slightly unsuccessful. See Marko's comment in the readme issue:
      The main problem I see with the readme day is that, because of the small amount of time, the large scope of topics and the fact that most students are starting from scratch, students _do not understand_ the material that they are presenting.*

    3 . Give students time to work on a project they care about. Through the selection process, we encourage students to come to the space with their own idea for furthering social good (in any given sector). We can give these students the time and support they need in order to do build on this idea.

    4 . Enable students to learn entrepreneurial skills. Since going to meetups to get work has fallen off the course, students are no longer exposed to biz-dev. As part of an overarching aim to create "founders" as well as "coders", this project will provide the following opportunities:

      *building a prototype with UX considerations at its core running user testing sessions pitching their MVP to fellow technologist and to users - this would be directly relevant in future, when applying for funding. I am thinking of the tech for good space here. increasing awareness of all roles involved in bringing a project to completion*

      *Are we able to advise students on the best way to go about getting actual real-world funding (yet)?*

  5 . Teach students about UX We had a ux week in the last syllabus. It is important that we incorporate some of this content and that students are taught about UX.
  7 . Teach students about user testing Since the students will have time to build something quite proper, and will be trying to build a real product, this will be a great time to try and do some **real** user testing.
  6 . Teach students to use agile methodologies I think we will need three weeks to do this. After one sprint, students do some user testing, followed by a planning session for sprint 2.

  em: They might need rewording, but I am not convinced these points do not sound better on their own. The main reason for these objectives is to convince other stakeholders the value of these points, we could rename objectives to outcomes? -

  *I defo would not put agile under entrepreneurial skills! good point! *

## Timetable
### Three week option

1 day: Mini hack, team building, project selection, intro to lean & agile concepts etc.
1 day: UX workshop, wireframing
6.5 days: Build sprint 1
0.5 days: user testing workshop
0.5 days: user testing
0.5 days: sprint planning
3.5 days: Build sprint 2
0.5 days: Launch / presentations
1 day: Funding proposals / day off ??

  * Instead, how about: 1st week = design sprint (prototype with no code) 2nd week = user testing with prototype & use this to build MVP 3rd week = user research (is my next feature a good idea?) & use this to inform next iteration? *

  * em: I like the idea of giving students maximum time to build stuff. This only gives the students one out of three weeks to code. That is less than the normal 2/5 days. The idea here is to let students take time to build something real. Two weeks of design / ux / user testing to one week of coding would not be something that interested me as a students.. *

  * I want this to feel like real life (absolutely with you on this!). Every forknight you start a new sprint, user testing happens alongside development. You do not shut down development at the end of a sprint to do  week of user testing! *

  * Oh, no. That's not what I meant,. 3rd week != user research and then stop. 3rd week begins with user research to find out whether your hypothesis for feature building is legit (think: Nelson's idea fof going to Google campus on the Friday after Redux, before Elm). That user research could be 0.5 day / 1 day? (I don't know how long you spend in real life) and then the students do spend the rest of the week actually building it. Same idea with week 2 - half a day or a day for user testing, all the rest is build. *

### Two week option
1 day: Mini hack, team building, project selection, intro to lean & agile concepts etc.
0.5 days: UX workshop, wireframing
6.5 days: Build sprint 1
0.5 days: user testing workshop
0.5 days: user testing
0.5 days: Launch / presentations
0.5 days: Funding proposal / time off.

  * Shouldn't user testing come at the beginning of the next sprint? What is the point in user testing, if they don't build anything based on what their findings? *

  * em: we only have one sprint, So I guess students could do user research at the beginning? They could do user testing at the end, it would still be good learning to try and evaluate what you have built. *

  * Depends what you think user testing is for. Perhaps it is still nice and informative as pure feedback. But I would like to see students understanding the true value of user testing! I don't think user testing should be about retrospective feedback & therefore a kind of "nice to have". It should inform what you build in the first place :)  Explaining its real value to students is the best way of enthusing them about it, both during the course and for sending them into the real world with that knowledge. *

  * Reading week f the project happens right after reading week then if might make sense to offer people recommended reading during that week,so they can read up about the libraries and frameworks they intend to use for their project. *
