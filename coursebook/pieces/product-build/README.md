# Product Build

## Outline

Students will complete a two / three week project after the taught course. In teams of two or four each project will allow students to further one or more of the following aims: build a product that they care about / learn entrepreneurial skills / learn new technologies that will directly impact their employability.

## Objectives (think: user stories)
  1. Allow students to learn technologies they feel will help them in the hiring process Some students have been frustrated in the past, as they have wanted to learn technologies they felt would help them get a job. This proposal gives students the chance to choose what they want to learn.
  2. Enable students to contribute to the community's learning resources, by creating readmes for other developers Each team which uses a technology that is not part of the curriculum is expected to document their learning. In this way, those that come after them can learn the same material in a shorter time-span. This can be done by contributing to an existing DWYL / FAC readme, or by starting a new one. Given that students will have 2 / 3 weeks learning this new technology, this will give them time to get the proper understanding required to write something useful for other developers. Previously there was no part of the course which has been effective in getting students to create readmes.
  3. Give students time to work on a project they care about. Through the selection process, we encourage students to come to the space with their own idea for furthering social good (in any given sector). We can give these students the time and support they need in order to do build on this idea.
  4. Enable students to learn entrepreneurial skills. Since going to meetups to get work has fallen off the course, students are no longer exposed to biz-dev. As part of an overarching aim to create "founders" as well as "coders", this project will provide the following opportunities:
  5. Teach students about UX We had a ux week in the last syllabus. It is important that we incorporate some of this content and that students are taught about UX.
  6. Teach students to use agile methodologies I think we will need three weeks to do this. After one sprint, students do some user testing, followed by a planning session for sprint 2.
  7. Teach students about user testing Since the students will have time to build something quite proper, and will be trying to build a real product, this will be a great time to try and do some **real** user testing.
