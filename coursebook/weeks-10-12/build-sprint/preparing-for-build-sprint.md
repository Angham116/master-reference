## Preparing for your build sprint
1. Depending on whether the results of your user testing have changed your idea significantly, you may need to re-do the following steps:
  - Break down your user journey into user stories
  - Draw up your wireframes

1. Talk through your [choice of tech stack](./tech-choices.md) with the help of your mentors.

1. [Sprint planning](https://github.com/dwyl/process-handbook#sprint-planning) with your Product Owner and Scrum Master:
  - Write out your tasks to be done in issues. Add:
    - pictures of your wireframes
    - acceptance criteria (define these with your PO)
    - priority labels (immport DWYL labels)
    - time estimates
    - Re-order the issues in your milestone accordingly
    - Assign issues

    Note: you may want to factor in technical spikes to your build time estimates, depending on your choice of tech stack.

1. Write your initial `README.md`

  Remember: You will have a time slot ("Today I Learned" in the 2nd week) for a quick show and tell. If you update your documentation as you go, you can use this to showcase what you have learned to the rest of your cohort.

1. Set up your environment
  - Deployment (e.g. Heroku)
  - Continuous Integration (e.g. Travis)
