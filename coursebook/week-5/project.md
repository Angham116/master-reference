News feed web app

A news feed is a service that provides users with frequently updated content on a regular or continuous basis. 

### Description

Create a website that will provide a news feed, with the content sourced via an API. 

### Example:

User Story:
'As a student at F&C I want to know all the train departure times from Bethnal Green tube station, so that I can get home in time for dinner'.

This news feed could be created with data provided via the [TFL API](https://api.tfl.gov.uk/).

### Specs:

1) Use at least 1 API 

2) Make your API calls from the back-end using the Request module (or one you build yourself)

2) Your server should contain a minimum of 2 routes

3) We expect back-end testing using tape (test as many components as you can) and basic front-end testing.

4) Test your server by injecting fake HTTP requests using Shot. 

5) Try to host your project on heroku, see resource.

6) Use module.exports and require to break a single large server file into smaller modules.

7) Consider what would be a good server file structure based on what we have discussed over the week.
