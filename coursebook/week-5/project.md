# Project

News feed web app

### Description

A website that will provide a news feed from an API. An example of this could be a news feed of bus times with the data provided by the [TFL API](https://api.tfl.gov.uk/). 

### Goals:

1) Use at lease 1 API

2) Your server should contain a minimum of 2 routes

3) We expect back-end testing using tape (test as many components as you can) and basic front-end testing.

4) Try to host your project on heroku, see resource.

5) Use module.exports and require to break a single large server file into smaller modules.

6) Consider what would be a good server file structure based on what we have discussed over the week.
