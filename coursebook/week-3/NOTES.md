**Mentors Notes:**

## Parallel Functions Morning Challenge
- Mentor should code along with students, so they can understand the concept of parallel functions and handling asynchronous functions.
- The solution should look like in [parallel-solution](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/blob/master/coursebook/week-3/parallel-solution.js), but without ```var hasFailed = false```, students should guess the error that will occur when we don't use it,the solution will work without it in case of one failure task(as in the example), so mentor need to add another failure task to show the problem in case we don't use ```hasFailed```.
