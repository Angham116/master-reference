# Creating your own JavaScript Kata

We'd like you to [create your own JavaScript kata on CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/new/javascript). 


+ Before creating your kata, you must carefully read through tips from Codewars on [creating your first kata](https://github.com/Codewars/codewars.com/wiki/Tutorial%3A-Create-Your-First-Kata) and [kata best practices](https://github.com/Codewars/codewars.com/wiki/Kata-Best-Practices)
+ Donâ€™t forget to [write random tests](https://github.com/codingforeveryone/READMEs/blob/master/codewars/random-test-cases-for-complete-beginners.md)!
+ Before publishing your kata, publish it as a draft and ask for feedback in the [Codewars community](https://gitter.im/Codewars/codewars.com/kata-authoring-help) (bear in mind it is not moderated by Founders and Coders)
