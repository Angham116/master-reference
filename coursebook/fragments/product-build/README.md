#### Presentation structure
+ Briefly go over the idea, as it was defined during the pitch / sprint planning
+ Demonstrate the existing features, specifically mentioning how well the initial users stories were met  
(Think: sprint review that your dev team might do for the PO, or a presentation that the PO might use for further funding)
+ Describe the next features you would implement  
(What did you learn from user testing & how can that inform your next sprint?)
+ Open up to Q&A from the rest of the cohort
+ Follow up by describing one technical challenge & one non-technical challenge that your team faced
