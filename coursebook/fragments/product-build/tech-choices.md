# Technology choices
Here is a non-exhaustive list of technolgies you may want to learn about

## Client-side

### React
A front-end framework. Mostly used to create the view layer of client side applications.
Used by [many](https://github.com/facebook/react/wiki/sites-using-react) startups and corporates in london, a good thing to learn if trying to get a job as a front end developer in London.

### Redux
A state management framework for client-side web applications. Most react projects use redux.

### Elm
An fp language used to create client-side applications. The choice technolgy for many people in FAC, but not widely used in the
industry.

### Angular
Like react, a front-end framework. Part of the `MEAN` stack, widly used in the industry in Israel. Also common in England.

### Tachyons
A CSS framework, extremely good for prototyping.

### D3
A data visualisation libary. Very powerful with a steep learning curve.

### Service Worker Background Push notifications
Here's the [API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Push_API), here's a useful backend [library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-push).

### Offline-First Progressive Web App
Good guide [here](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/codelabs/your-first-pwapp/).

## Server-side

### Express
Most commonly used node framework. Easier to learn than Hapi. Also part of the `MEAN` stack.

### Redis
No Sql database. Fast and scaleable in-memory key-value store. Used for session management and caching. Also has a powerful pub-sub mechanism.

### Web-Sockets
Allows servers to push data to clients, used for push notifaction, real-time colaboration, PWAs.

### Mongo
A no sql document db. Easy to use. Part of the `MEAN` stack.

## Advanced JavaScript

### Functional Programming with Ramda
[Ramda](http://ramdajs.com/docs/). Best to start with [this](https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide).

### Async/Await
Now in Node v7, can be transpiled in browsers. Allows promise code to be written that appears synchronous. [API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function). (There is also a [version of express](http://koajs.com/) that uses it heavily.
