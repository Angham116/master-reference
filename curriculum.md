# Plan

10 weeks
+ 2 weeks dwyl?
+ 4 weeks client projects

16 weeks / 4 months

## Questions:

 * what is dwyl doing for weeks 11 & 12?
 * how does this relate to the master ref. If we have learning outcomes + project can we put something in??
 * things missing in curriculum: front-end framework, build tools, sass, UX, where does it fit?

## General:

 * we need tdd workshops & project management talks spread throughout the course so there
 is a steady integration of agile practices.
 * design each week around what they will need for the project.
 * each week should evolve into and prepare you for the next. students should
 regularly get to practice what they learnt in prior weeks.
 * regular week structure.
