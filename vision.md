# Vision

**This document outlines a long term vision for the master-reference.**

This is a draft. Along with some of my (@des-des's) ideas, some of this has come out of conversations I have had with @bradreeder. Inspiration also from @bradreeder's thoughts on creating [a pattern language](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/a-pattern-language/issues/2).

## Aims of the Master Reference
 * To define a methodology for building a curriculum.
 * To supply a set of resources that can be used to build a curriculum.
 * To allow a single point of collaboration between campuses without impeding on the autonomy of any one campus

## Glossery of Terms

 * *Curriculum*: An ordered collection of *week*s that will make up the curriculum students will follow at a campus.
 * *Week*: A ordered collection of *part*s that will take 5 days to complete.
 * *Part*: One of: a workshop, a research afternoon, a morning challenge, a talk or a project.


 ## Implementation
  * Some *part*s will live outside of the master reference. For now these are workshops and morning challenges. Weeks and the other parts will live inside the master reference.

  * Each week and part should have clear **learning outcomes** and  **prerequisites**. These should have the same format so that mentors can make sure the prerequisites of any given task have been covered in the learning outcomes of previously undertaken tasks.

  * The level of crossover between two different campuses is at the discretion of those campuses.

  * Any week / curriculum can be easily reassembled. The final curriculum of any single campus will live in a repository belonging to a campus.
